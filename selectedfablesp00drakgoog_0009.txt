PREFACE

--000—

Tuis selectiou of fahles has been prepared for use in reading
Latin aloud and, its natural concomitant, reading without a
dictionary. The quantities have been marked rather than the
accepts, iu the belief that better results in reading aloud can be
reached by observing carefully the length of the vowels‚ than
by attempting to follow mechanically the rhythmos the verse.
For the same practical reason, it is suggested that the teacher
follow Lucian Mueller's theory of the structure of the Latin
verse,¹ remembering that the principle of quantity was the only
one taken into account, and that the prose acceut was neglected
in the reading of poetry. Whatever may be said for or against
this theory from the scientific point of view, it seems to furnish
the best pedagogical solution ol the much discussed problem of
the relation of metrical ictus and prose accent.

The few notes given with the text are such as l have
found by actual trial had to be supplied to a class, composed
mainly of sophomores and juniors in the University of Michigan‚
who had prepared their less'ons without the aid of a lexicon or
vocabulary. From the fact that the Latin is so simple, the book
may be made usesul in the high school course, by substituting it
for some part of the regular work. The marked quantities will
make easy the drill in reading aloud, so often neglected, in our
high schools, much to the detriment of the pupils.
