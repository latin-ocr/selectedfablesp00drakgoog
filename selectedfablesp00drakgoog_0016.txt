before Christ. Those fables that show internal evidence of not
having been written by him may be explained as interpolations
ofa later time. Certnin itis that by the close of the fifth century

before Christ, Aesop was firmly established as the ‘patron saint

of fable' among the Greeks. For a full discussion of this ques· ¹

Greek Fable!

The original version of the fables of Aesop was in prose.
Socrates is said to have turned some of these into elegiae verse
during his imprisonment. Demetrius of Phaleron arranged a
collection of Aesop's fables in prose, which was afterward fol·
lowed by other Greek fabulists. These prose fables have not
come down to our times, but are known to us through the
poetical versions of PhaedruS, Babrius, and Avianus. The sev-
eral versions in prose now extant are a product of later times.

Phaedrus, who introduced the fables of Aesop into Latin liter-
ature in metrica] form, is mentioned once by Martial (Epig. ΙΙΙ,
20, 5); by other contemporary authors, not at all. We must,
therefore, depend for our knowledge of his life and character,
upon what he himself tells us in the prologues and epilognes to
the several books of his fables.· Born in Pieria in Macedonia,
he came to Rome as a slave, early in life, received his freedom
from Augustus or Tiberius, and during the reign of the latter,
published the first two books of his fables. The third book was
dedicated to a freedman of Gaius Caesar or Claudius, Eutychus
by name3 the fourth to particulo, a favorite of Claudius. The
fifth book was published later in its author's life, which seems to
have been prolonged to a great age.

From the title of his work, ‘Phaedri Augusti Liberti Fabula-
rum Aesopiamm Libri,' there is some reason for the difference of
opinion that exists as to the identity of his patronus, though it

is very probable that the Augustus referred to is Octavianus, ’
since Tiberius is usually called Caesar Tiberius, and' not Augus- ,
