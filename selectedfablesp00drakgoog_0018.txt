xii Introduction

some critIcs, differing in style. Now Book 11 and Book V of
the regular text are much shorter than the others, and in the
Prologus to Book l the author apologiaes for allowing trees to

talk in his Iables, an apology that seems unnecessary, since there l

is no instance of such an occurrence in the collection that we
have. Furthermore, Fables XIII and XIV of Book IV are
manifestly incompleta. From these facts, it is believed that in
the manuscript to which Perotti had access in making his collec-
tion, there were fables which have not come down to us through
other chameis, and in modern editions of Phaedrus these tables
are usually added to the five books that are known to belong to
this author.

The anticipation of posthumous fame so natvely expressed by
Phaedrus has not been realized to the extent that the author
hoped, though he might, is living, be content with the reputation
of being the only Latin sabulist of the classic period. His faults
as well as his virtues are those ofa little mind. His lack of
judgment and failure to see clearly the true meanIng of the
sables, shown particularly in their application and their unskillIul

·variations from the Greek originals‚ are not less marked than
the clearness with which he brings situations before his readers,
and the finish in form os some os his fables.

His verse is iambic trimeter or senarius of the form

u-v-v-V-v-v!

The last foot is always an iambus or pyrrhic. In the other feet
we may have, instead of an iambus : -

(1) The spondae (- ..), most commonly in the fifth foot.

(2) The anapaest (o υ -), particularly in the first and fifth
foot, never two in succession. ’

(3) The dactyl (.. υ υ), oftenest in the first, third, and
fourth foot.

(4) The tribrach (υ υ o), never in such a position that a
word ends with it.

(5) The proceleusmatIcus (υ υ υ υ), only at the beginning
of a verse.
