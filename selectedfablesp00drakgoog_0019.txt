Introduction xiii

The dactyl and the tribrach rarely1 occur with a following
anapaest or a tribrach, the proceleusmaticus never.

The caesura usually falls in the third foot, sometimes in the
fourth.

The following peculiarities in the prosody of Phaedrus should
be kept in mind: —

dem is always a monosyllable.

deinde is always a dissyllable.

diutius, not diritius, is regularly used.

erunt in the perfect is often erunt

tilius 1, 14, 8, but illius ΙΙΙ, Prol. 38.

substantives in ius and ium sometimes retain and sometimes

drop the second i in the genitive singular.
ruchercule and mehercules are always trisyllables, pronounced
mercule and me‘rcule‘s.

miluus is always a trisyllable.

ne'scio is sometimes a dissyllable.

quondam is always a trisyllable.

Othe'r variations peculiar to the passages in which they occur
are mentioned in the notes.

lt is taken for granted that the student knows that final i in
mitt tibi, sibi, and ubi, which is commonly short, may some-
times be long, and that final o of the first person singular of the
verb, commonly long, may sometimes be short.
