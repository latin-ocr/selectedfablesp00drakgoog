In my Introduction 1 am indebted to W. G. Rutherford's
‘Babrius'; to the' school editions of Phaedrus by Siebelis and
Raschig, though 1 am compelled to differ with the latter in some
of his conclusions (see note to p. xiii); to Lucian Mueller,
‘Phaedri Fabulae Aesopiae,’ praefatio, p. viii-xii; andro P.
Langen, ‘Ueber die Metrik des Phaedrus,' Rhein. Mus. xiii,
197-208. The textis Lucian Mueller's, Bonn, 1867, though the
orthography has been made consistent throughout. Except in
oese of obvious misprints, lewis's ‘Elementary Latin Dictionary‘
has been followed in marking the quantities.

For aid in reading the proof‚ and for many helpful sugges-
tions, my thanks are due to Professor John C. Rolfe and Mr.
C. L. Meader, of the University of Michigan‚ also to Professor
W. K. Clemeut, of the University of ldaho.
